Start the Xerox Machine - Quick image showcase script.

### What is this?
This is a very simple script that loads all the images within a folder (via AJAX) and injects them in a page.

### But why?
See, I used to have a moodboard in AMB1, an app based in Dropbox, but that's not working anymore. I used my AMB1 to collect images from around the web for inspiration, and to copy ideas (hence the "start the xerox machine"). This scripts does exactly that for me, and I can host it locally or quickly set up a repo with Github pages or even just drag-and-drop it to Netlify.

### How to use it
1. Edit the text in `index.html` (title, subtitle, etc).
2. Dump a bunch of image files inside the `img` folder (jpeg, jpg, png, gif and svg are supported)
3. Run it in a web server and open it in your browser.

The easiest way to run it locally is by using Live Server (included in Visual Studio Code).
To put online just transfer the files to any web server. Static hosting works.

### What to use it for
- Moodboards
- Quick sharing photos
- Image curation
- For the keks
